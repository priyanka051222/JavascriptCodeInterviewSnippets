      Debounce vs throttle

          Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that
          time-consuming tasks do not fire so often, that it stalls the
          performance of the web page. In other words, it limits the rate at
          which a function gets invoked.
          <button id="debounce">
            Debounce
          </button>
        </p>
        <p>
          Application: Debouncing can be applied in implementing suggestive
          text, where we wait for the user to stop typing for a few seconds
          before suggesting the text. thus, on every keystroke, we wait for some
          seconds before giving out suggestions. Another application of
          debouncing is in content-loading webpages like Facebook and Twitter
          where the user keeps on scrolling. In these scenarios, if the scroll
          event is fired too frequently, there might be a performance impact, as
          it contains lots of videos and images. Thus the scroll event must make
          use of debouncing.

          A throttle is a cousin of the debounce, and they both improve the
          performance of web applications. However, they are used in different
          cases. A debounce is utilized when you only care about the final
          state. For example, waiting until a user stops typing to fetch
          typeahead search results. A throttle is best used when you want to
          handle all intermediate states but at a controlled rate. For example,
          track the screen width as a user resizes the window and rearrange page
          content while it changes instead of waiting until the user has
          finished.
